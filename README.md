EXAM TEST APP

This is the example of Exam Test App using Swing

This app includes the following functions:
1. Login/Register
2. Login as Root
3. The Exam Test(in progress)
4. While you're in Login/Register, you cannot exit the app. Just login as root can exit the app.
5. Login/Register system:
   - You can login account
   - It has account and password checking feature.
   - If you enter the wrong password 5 times, the app will freeze for 5 seconds
6. Login as root:
   - You can manage the application
   - Can add/delete user
   - Can show list of account
   - Can show application

THIS IS JUST A TEST VERSION. I JUST LEARNED PROGRAMMING SO THE APP LOOKS A BIT UGLY. SORRY FOR MY BAD ENGLISH =))
